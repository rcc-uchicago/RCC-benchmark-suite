The 2 folders in this folder dm-only and neutrinos are separate simulations.
In each folder, there are 2 files parameter.genic and parameter.gadget. 
The former is used to generate an initial condition file stored in an folder named output/.
The latter is used to run the simulation from the initialization.

For each simulation, the metrics of interest is the time to solution
as a function of the number of MPI tasks, or compute nodes. This is the strong scaling
performance of the MP-GADGET software on the given hardware configuration.

The script run.sh in each folder illustrates how the runs are performed. 

The performance of a run is measured by the time it takes to reach the TimeMax value in paramfile.gadget.
The output/cpu.txt file contains the elapsed time at the final step, which can be converted
to the performance in term of timesteps/s = number_of_timesteps / elapsed_time.
